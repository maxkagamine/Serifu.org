/// <summary>
/// Static methods for generating stable quote IDs. The resulting ID is eight bytes combining the <see cref="Source"/>
/// with a source-specific series of bits. This allows for efficient updates compared to GUIDs when re-importing a
/// source's quotes and can also act as an implicit sort order if needed.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// ID format:
/// <code>
///   [ Source     ] [ Ship #     ] [ Index                    ]  // Kancolle
///   [ Source     ] [ Form ID                  ] [ Response # ]  // Skyrim, Oblivion
///   [ Source     ] [ Unused     ] [ Index                    ]  // Generic
/// </code>
/// Example: 281486755364865 â†’ Skyrim, form id 0002BE10, response #1
/// </remarks>
